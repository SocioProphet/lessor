# Architecture Decisions

Architecturally significant changes to this project are documented as a collection of records. Documents are numbered sequentially and monotonically. If a decision is reversed, we will keep the old one around, but mark it as superseded (it's still relevant to know that it was the decision, but is no longer the decision).

If you'd like to make a significant change to this program, copy [the template](./1970-01-01_template.md) and submit a PR which explains your proposal. Your proposal may accompany a working prototype, but significant decisions should be documented before there is significant development.
